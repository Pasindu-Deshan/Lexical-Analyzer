# Lexical-Analyzer
This Git repository contains the source code and documentation for a Lexical Analyzer. A Lexical Analyzer, also known as a lexer or scanner, is a crucial component of a compiler that breaks down the source code into tokens for further processing by the compiler.

# Features
Tokenization: The lexical analyzer efficiently identifies and extracts tokens from the input source code, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

Regular Expressions: The implementation employs regular expressions to define the lexical rules, making it flexible and extensible for various programming languages.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is provided to understand the design, implementation details, and usage of the Lexical Analyzer.
